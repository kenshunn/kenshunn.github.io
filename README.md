## Welcome to kenshunn's personal website. https://kenshunn.github.io/

#### How I accomplished each item in the criteria
I was able to apply the use of HTML tags, CSS selectors, CSS styles, Flexbox. Although I wasn't able to apply much animations, because I wanted to make my website as simple as it could be. And for my website's responsiveness, I was only able to make 2 types, as I was having a hard time to fix the positionings through media query. For my design I simply followed a website tutorial on how to make one, and I know for myself that the color pallete that I used doesn't fit very well together. For the contents of my website, It has a lot of whitespace, because as I don't have that much to put in, in the mean time.

#### Insights that I've gathered while doing the Guided Exercise 1
I've learned that HTML is somewhat easy to use, and I've learned that HTML, CSS and JavaScript has some connection with each other. I couldn't say much as I've only learned the basics in these languages, and I'm willing to learn more in the near future.

#### Struggles that I've encountered during the Guided Exercise 1
I've had a quite a lot of struggles, specially in navigating the HTML for it to be styled with CSS. Biggest struggle that I've encountered is the use of Flexbox and CSS, due to the positioning and the connection of its corresponding id in HTML.

#### How could I improve my website in the future?
Main thing that I would do to improve my website, is to study and learn more about these languages. As well as watching some tutorials and practicing at the same time.

#### Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
I could see that I'm bad at choosing color palletes or combination. I am also impatient on fixing the positions of each items.
